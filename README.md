# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The main objective is to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the classes of images within the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset employed in this project is the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), which consists of 60,000 32x32 colour images across 10 distinct classes. Each class contains 6,000 images, with a division of 50,000 for training and 10,000 for testing.

### Classes:
1. Airplane
2. Automobile
3. Bird
4. Cat
5. Deer
6. Dog
7. Frog
8. Horse
9. Ship
10. Truck

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) play a crucial role in this project, as they are well-suited for image classification tasks. CNNs excel at capturing spatial hierarchies and learning intricate patterns from image data.
